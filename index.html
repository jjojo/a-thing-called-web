<!-- The <head> tag container is used for meta data (data about data). This section is
    global and is usually where you specify the title of your webpage, style, charsets,
    scaling, base hrefs and link to other files or libraries. -->

          * width=device-width  Sets the width of the page to the same as the 
                                screen-width of the device (mobile, tablet, computer, etc).
          * initial-scale=1.0   Sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded

         The id= is called a tag attribute and is used as a reference to the element.
         We can then use it to change the element with JavaScript or CSS. -->
    <p id="game-message">Let us play some tic tac toe!</p>

    <!-- HTML5 allows us to come up with our own tags as well, let us try that!
         We will use the <tic-tac-toe-board> to wrap the board. -->
    <tic-tac-toe-board>
        <!-- For the tic tac toe board we need 9 places to place our Os and Xs.
            We are going to use <div> tags for this. <div> tags are very common 
            and used for division or sections in HTML. They are often used as 
            containers for other tags, css and javaScript functions.
        
            The onclick= is an event listener, when a click event occurrs on the div we 
            call the JavaScript function named placeMark(clickedElementId, row, col).
                * this.id is the elements id, we pass this as a parameter to the function.
                * The first digit (0 in first div) is the row number of the board.
                * The second digit (also 0 in first div) is the column number of the board.
